The Classic Emote Dealer

## Emote Dealer
Emote Dealer deals out any reaction emote images and gifs that have been added to the bot whenever you say their name. Just send the name of the emote (case-sensitive) and Emote Dealer will instantly upload it.
No need for buying discord nitro now for extra emotes or stickers! WOW!


## Emote Salesman
Emote Salesman's `/add [name] [URL]` command allows you to add any PNG, JPG, or GIF file to the bot.
The URL must end in the file extension, and the name can contain special characters like ??!!++, but must be a single word
